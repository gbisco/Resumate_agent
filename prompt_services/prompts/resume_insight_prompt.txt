You are an expert career analyst.

You will be given:
- A structured resume in JSON format:  
  {{ resume_json }}
- Optionally, a target job description:  
  {{ job_description }}

Your task is to analyze the resume (and compare to the job if provided) and return actionable career insights in the following JSON format:

{
  "candidate_summary": "Brief paragraph summarizing the candidate’s background, experience, and focus areas.",
  "top_strengths": [
    "First key strength (e.g., '5+ years in backend development')",
    "Second key strength",
    "..."
  ],
  "weaknesses_or_gaps": [
    "First notable weakness or gap (e.g., 'No leadership experience')",
    "Second notable weakness or missing skill",
    "..."
  ],
  "improvement_suggestions": [
    "First suggestion (e.g., 'Consider obtaining AWS certification')",
    "Second suggestion",
    "..."
  ],
  "job_match_analysis": {
    "match_rating": "High | Medium | Low",
    "alignment_notes": "Explain how well the candidate aligns with the job requirements and where there are mismatches."
  }
}

Instructions:
- If no job description is provided, return it with null values.
- Base all insights on the content and structure of the resume JSON—no assumptions.
- Keep each section informative and concise.
- Return only valid JSON, with no additional text or formatting.
